### turn your dumpster fire into a campfire today!

You can include campfire into your site with just an import statement, either
from a location where you are hosting it, or from esm.sh / unkpg.

```ts
import cf from "https://esm.sh/campfire.js@4";
```

or

```ts
import { ListStore, nu } from "https://esm.sh/campfire.js@4";
```

If you use a bundler or want to write in TypeScript, you can install Campfire
from npm. This gives you full TypeScript support as well as TSDoc comments.

To install:

```sh
npm install --save-dev campfire.js
```

Then in your code:

```ts
import cf from "campfire.js";
```

Good luck, and thank you for choosing Campfire!
