### turn your dumpster fire into a campfire today!

You can include campfire into your site with just an import statement, either from a location where
you are hosting it, or from esm.sh.

```ts
import cf from "https://esm.sh/jsr/@campfire/core@4";
```

or

```ts
import { ListStore, nu } from "https://esm.sh/jsr/@campfire/core@4";
```

If you use a bundler or want to write in TypeScript, you can install Campfire from npm. This gives
you full TypeScript support as well as TSDoc comments.

To install:

```sh
pnpm i jsr:@campfire/core
```

Then in your code:

```ts
import cf from "@campfire/core";
```

Good luck, and thank you for choosing Campfire!
